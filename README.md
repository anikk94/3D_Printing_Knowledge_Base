# 3D Printing Knowledge Base

```Author: Anirudh Krishnan Komaralingam```

This book is meant to catalog my 3D printing journey and host useful for quick lookup on as many printers that I am able to catalog. Each chapter covers one printer completely. The structure of this book may change in the future.
