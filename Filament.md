## Fliament Drying
> https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/15plahp/what_filament_dryer_would_you_recommend/

There have been so many posts about dryers and humidity lately, I just have a comment that I have been copying, pasting, and adding to. ... kind of messy though.

Not everyone needs a dryer or drybox.
While filament can come slightly moist new, it is more of a problem for those that live in rain forest conditions - 70%+ humidity all the time.
If it is consistently over 40% inside your house / printing area, drying and/or printing from a drybox will improve your printing and the results.

New filament can also be wet. That tiny packet of desiccant doesn't do much. It's just enough so the filament won't get wetter. I have had 2 spools be dry when opened in the past year.
One (or more) of the steps when making 3D filament is a water bath. On a humid day, that is not going to evaporate away before it is packaged.

These recommendations are made under the following conditions.
- Ambient RH:50%
- Ambient Temp:25°C (77°F)
- 1kg filament spool
