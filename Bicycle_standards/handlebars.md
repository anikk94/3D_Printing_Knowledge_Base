2. Standard bicycle handlebar sizes (diameters)
2.1. Stem clamp diameter standards
Current standards for stem clamp diameter are given in the table 1:

TABLE 1	 
Handlebar attachment diameter – measurement units: mm (inches)	 Standard name
22.2 (7/8″)	for steel bars of old MTB and BMX bikes, and some small kids’ bicycles
23.8 (15/16″)	Obsolete British standard common on old British 3-speeds
25	Obsolete French standard
25.4 (1″)	Standard ISO size, common for bars from the end of the 20th century
26	Italian road bike (and bar) standard. Obsolete
27	Titan – obsolete standard

31.7 – 31.8 – depending on how manufacturers round down the inch dimension which is (1 1/4″)	Modern “oversized” standard
35 (1 3/8″)	Easton standard
– T.O.C. –


2.2. Standard handlebar grip area diameters
There are only two current standard sizes:

Flat bars have a 22.2 mm (7/8″) grip area diameter.
Road (“drop”) bars have a 23.8 mm (15/16″) grip area diameter.
– T.O.C. –


2.3. Overview of all (including obsolete) handlebar size standards
Table 2 gives an overview of all the handlebar size standards, with a short explanation of each.

TABLE 2	 	 
Stem clamp diameter	Grip diameter	Standard explanation
mm (inches)	mm (inches)	 
22.2 to 31.8
(varies)	19	Small kids’ bicycle handlebars.
22.2  (7/8)	22.2  (7/8)	Mostly steel bars of BMX and old mountain bikes.
23,8  (15/16)	22,2  (7/8)	Obsolete old British 3-speed standard, also used on old British steel drop bars.
25	23,5	Obsolete French standard.
25.4  (1)	22.2  (7/8)	Standard I.S.O. size, used on many flat bar bicycles at the end of the 20th century. Today mostly present on lower end models.
25.4  (1)	23.8  (15/16)	Standard I.S.O. size, used on many drop bar bicycles at the end of the 20th century. Today a bit less common, mostly used on low end models.
25.8	23.8  (15/16)	Unofficial “in-between” size used by some Italian manufacturers so that the bars can be used with both ISO (25.4 mm) and Italian (26 mm) sized stems.

31.8  (1 1/4)	22.2  (7/8)	Modern “oversized” standard for flat bars.
31.8  (1 1/4)	23.8  (15/16)	Modern “oversized” standard for drop bars.
